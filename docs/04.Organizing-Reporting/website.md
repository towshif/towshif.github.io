# A Website On Github.io
Creating content for websites can be very painful from shell console. While the terminal can be used for running the site and various other purposes, we still need a visual code editor for creating advanced visual components and content for webpages. 

Some popular code open source (free) editor for a desktop type environment are `Visual Studio Code` by Microsoft, `Atom` by Github and `Sublime Text` by Jon Skinner, Will Bond. These come with very advanced code editing features and are very easy to use.

In this tutorial however we are not going to use a desktop enviroment so rather than installing a local editor we will switch to web based editor. Some examples of hosting services that provide these editors are 

* [CodeAnywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/editor/)
* [Codenvy](https://codeanywhere.com)
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
* [Amazon C9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/?origin=c9io)

Each of these come integrated with a shell (a virtual machine) that we can use to execute commands.

For this tutorial we will use GCP - Google Cloud Platform. Please refer to the Setup Tutorial for Google Cloud Console.

## Google Cloud Code editor 

Once you have setup your cloud shell environment fire up the terminal in your browser and make a clone of the repo for the website we created in the previous tutorial `username.github.io`. 

    git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io

You will be able to visualize the repository and its folder structure in the google cloud code editor.
