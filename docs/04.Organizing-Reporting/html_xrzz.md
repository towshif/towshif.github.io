# Exercise: Create webpage on Github.io

In the previous tutorial we already hosted a simple index.html file with "Hello World" text. We will further develop on this repository and create a better webpage for you bio. 

This is the [bio page](https://towshif.github.io/) we will try to mimic. As you can see there are a few components we want to update first.

* profile images  
* Bio text 

The sample html file for this page is available here 

    cd username.github.io
