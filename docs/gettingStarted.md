# Getting Started 

I am not sure how to start this, because this is a pretty vast topic. "Coding".
But I thought I will begin by telling a story of 'C'.

We wrote C when we were children. Only now I realize it was probably the most difficult language I ever learnt, though at the time it seemed to be the most exciting.

The simplest of things I think are hardest to get right. 

Hope you enjoy this series of tutorials. 

thanks
