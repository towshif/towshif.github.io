## 1st Date
Here goes the encounter of Prscum and serendipity who by virtue of fate had come to meet each other and make this story. 

Still rembering that day when Prscum was stuck right here 
> import tensorflow as tf 

and getting this error 

> segmentation fault (core dumped)  python

thanks
