This concludes the 10 min tutorial. Keep reading for advanced configurations with ssh. Putty Fonts, Themes and Appearance: Customizing Putty with powerline Powerline is a really nice looking command prompt and vim status bar. When working on my linux machine, it was very easy to install following the instructions. Trying to get it to work in Windows and PuTTY, however, took a bit of sleuthing. To add onto the complexity, the project has changed, and some of the information that is out there is outdated. So, here is what I did to make it work: Follow the installation instructions for powerline Download and install (double click for install menu) the DejaVu font in Windows. Some of the other fonts in the site worked, and others didn't. PuTTY seems to be picky on what fonts it will use, and the DejaVu font is a nice looking mono-spaced font, so it is a good starting point. (Re)run PuTTY and create a new session with the following settings Window-Appearance-Font = DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline Window-Appearance-Font Quality = ClearType Window-Translation-Character Set = UTF-8 Verify your linux locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8 (mine was out of the box) Verify that your .vimrc has set encoding=utf-8 Verify your term session is capable of 256 colors (TERM=xterm-256color) In addition you can also customize the Colours > ANSI Blue to (RGB) = (108, 108, 187). This will lighten the blue shades of powerline fonts. Useful for Agnoster type arrow themes. And that's it! ssh authentication KEYS Advanced usage with encryption KEYS. To use keys first you need to generate a key pair containing public key [remains in server or the host] ; format .pub (Unix) and .ppk (windows Putty) private key [used by client] Usage Syntax for ssh connection with keys: ssh -i [PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY] [USERNAME]@[IP_ADDRESS] Example: ssh -i /home/towshif/.ssh/AWS-Server2019-Key -p 6789 towshif@server.gentoo.com How To Set Up SSH Keys on Host and Client (Linux) Now lets look at how to setup server and client to use keys. With keys you can also skip password for ssh login. 1. Step One\u2014Create the RSA Key Pair The first step is to create the key pair on the `client` machine (there is a good chance that this will just be your computer): ssh-keygen -t rsa advanced usage: ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/[KEY_FILENAME] -C [USERNAME] Step Two\u2014Store the Keys and Passphrase Once you have entered the Gen Key command, you will get a few more questions: Enter file in which to save the key (/home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa): # You can press enter here, saving the file to the user home (in this case, my example user is called demo). Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Example: The entire key generation process looks like this: ssh-keygen -t rsa Output Generating public/private rsa key pair. Enter file in which to save the key (/home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa): Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Enter same passphrase again: Your identification has been saved in /home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa. Your public key has been saved in /home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. The key fingerprint is: 4a:dd:0a:c6:35:4e:3f:ed:27:38:8c:74:44:4d:93:67 demo@a The key's randomart image is: +--[ RSA 2048]----+ | .oo. | | . o.E | | + . o | | . = = . | | = S = . | | o + = + | | . o + o . | | . o | | | +-----------------+ The public key is now located in /home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. The private key (identification) is now located in /home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa. List the contents of ~/.ssh to view the key files. Public key file: ~/.ssh/[KEY_FILENAME].pub Private key file: ~/.ssh/[KEY_FILENAME] where [KEY_FILENAME] is the filename of the SSH key, which was set when the key was created. Restrict access to the private key so only you (this USER) can access it chmod 400 ~/.ssh/[KEY_FILENAME] Private keys can be used from different clients to connect to the host. Step Three\u2014Copy the Public Key to Host Server that you want to access. Once the key pair is generated, it's time to place the public key on the server that we want to use. You can copy the public key into the new machine's authorized_keys file with the ssh-copy-id command. Make sure to replace the example username and IP address below. ssh-copy-id demo@198.51.100.0 OR copy manually like this or any way you prefer. cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh demo@198.51.100.0 \"mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\" Either one you choose you will see similar output as this The authenticity of host '198.51.100.0 (198.51.100.0)' can't be established.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes Warning: Permanently added '198.51.100.0' (RSA) to the list of known hosts. user@198.51.100.0's password: Remember to change permisson for public key to 700 on your remote server. Make sure you're logged in as the user for whom the key was created. Then, ensure your .ssh directory on the server, and the files it contains, have the correct permissions: chmod 700 ~/.ssh/[KEY_FILENAME].pub # optional if you are only user chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys To Create ssh keys on Windows with putty use this reference: SSH keys on Windows Log In Using Your Private Key You can now SSH or SFTP into your server using your private key. From the command line, you can use: ssh SYSUSER@x.x.x.x If you didn't create your key in the default location, you'll need to specify the location: ssh -i ~/.ssh/custom_key_name SYSUSER@x.x.x.x OR a more verbose syntax # -l [USER] # -i [PATH TO PRIVATE KEY] # -p [PORT] ssh -i /nfs/shared/users/nixcraft/keys/server1/id_rsa -p 4242 -l nixcraft server1.cyberciti.biz Retrieve Your Public Key from Your Private Key The following command will retrieve the public key from a private key: ssh-keygen -y This can be useful, for example, if your server provider generated your SSH key for you and you were only able to download the private key portion of the key pair. Note that you cannot retrieve the private key if you only have the public key. If you're using a Windows SSH client, such as PuTTy, look in the configuration settings to specify the path to your private key. ssh Tips Using ssh config file for easy login : More Info Create a file config in ~/.ssh dir and you can populate it with the host login configurations that are frequently used by that machine. Note : passwords are not allowed to be saven in this file. If config file doesnot exist create one touch ~/.ssh/config vi ~/.ssh/config Set permissions on ~/.ssh/config chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config Sample basic config : Host scotch HostName scotch.io User nick Host example2 HostName example.com User root Host example3 HostName 64.233.160.0 User userxyz123 Port 56000 Host amazon1 HostName ec2.amazon.com User ec2-user IdentityFile /path/to/special/privatekey/amazonKey ServerAliveInterval 60 ServerAliveCountMax 30 For host \"amazon1\" there are ServerAliveInterval and ServerAliveCountMax options.

By operating system, we mean the suite of programs which make the computer work. UNIX is used by the workstations and multi-user servers within the school. On X terminals and the workstations, X Windows provide a graphical interface between the user and UNIX. However, knowledge of UNIX is required for operations which aren't covered by a graphical program, or for when there is no X windows system, for example, in a telnet session. The UNIX operating system The UNIX operating system is made up of three parts; the kernel , the shell and the programs . The kernel The kernel of UNIX is the hub of the operating system: it allocates time and memory to programs and handles the filestore and communications in response to system calls. As an illustration of the way that the shell and the kernel work together, suppose a user types rm myfile (which has the effect of removing the file myfile ). The shell searches the filestore for the file containing the program rm, and then requests the kernel, through system calls, to execute the program rm on myfile. When the process rm myfile has finished running, the shell then returns the UNIX prompt % to the user, indicating that it is waiting for further commands. The shell The shell acts as an interface between the user and the kernel. When a user logs in, the login program checks the username and password, and then starts another program called the shell. The shell is a command line interpreter (CLI). It interprets the commands the user types in and arranges for them to be carried out. The commands are themselves programs: when they terminate, the shell gives the user another prompt ( % or $ on our systems). The adept user can customise his/her own shell, and users can use different shells on the same machine. Staff and students in the school have the tcsh shell by default. The tcsh shell has certain features to help the user inputting commands. Filename Completion - By typing part of the name of a command, filename or directory and pressing the [Tab] key, the tcsh shell will complete the rest of the name automatically. If the shell finds more than one name beginning with those letters you have typed, it will beep, prompting you to type a few more letters before pressing the tab key again. History - The shell keeps a list of the commands you have typed in. If you need to repeat a command, use the cursor keys to scroll up and down the list or type history for a list of previous commands. Files and processes Everything in UNIX is either a file or a process. A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process identifier). A file is a collection of data. They are created by users using text editors, running compilers etc. Examples of files: a document (report, essay etc.) the text of a program written in some high-level programming language instructions comprehensible directly to the machine and incomprehensible to a casual user, for example, a collection of binary digits (an executable or binary file); a directory, containing information about its contents, which may be a mixture of other directories (subdirectories) and ordinary files. The Directory Structure All the files are grouped together in the directory structure. The file-system is arranged in a hierarchical structure, like an inverted tree.

By operating system, we mean the suite of programs which make the computer work. UNIX is used by the workstations and multi-user servers within the school. On X terminals and the workstations, X Windows provide a graphical interface between the user and UNIX. However, knowledge of UNIX is required for operations which aren't covered by a graphical program, or for when there is no X windows system, for example, in a telnet session.","title":"Introduction to UNIX"},{"location":"01.UNIX-Tutorial/intro/#the-unix-operating-system","text":"The UNIX operating system is made up of three parts; the kernel , the shell and the programs .","title":"The UNIX operating system"},{"location":"01.UNIX-Tutorial/intro/#the-kernel","text":"The kernel of UNIX is the hub of the operating system: it allocates time and memory to programs and handles the filestore and communications in response to system calls. As an illustration of the way that the shell and the kernel work together, suppose a user types rm myfile (which has the effect of removing the file myfile ). The shell searches the filestore for the file containing the program rm, and then requests the kernel, through system calls, to execute the program rm on myfile. When the process rm myfile has finished running, the shell then returns the UNIX prompt % to the user, indicating that it is waiting for further commands.","title":"The kernel"},{"location":"01.UNIX-Tutorial/intro/#the-shell","text":"The shell acts as an interface between the user and the kernel. When a user logs in, the login program checks the username and password, and then starts another program called the shell. The shell is a command line interpreter (CLI). It interprets the commands the user types in and arranges for them to be carried out. The commands are themselves programs: when they terminate, the shell gives the user another prompt ( % or $ on our systems). The adept user can customise his/her own shell, and users can use different shells on the same machine. Staff and students in the school have the tcsh shell by default. The tcsh shell has certain features to help the user inputting commands. Filename Completion - By typing part of the name of a command, filename or directory and pressing the [Tab] key, the tcsh shell will complete the rest of the name automatically. If the shell finds more than one name beginning with those letters you have typed, it will beep, prompting you to type a few more letters before pressing the tab key again. History - The shell keeps a list of the commands you have typed in. If you need to repeat a command, use the cursor keys to scroll up and down the list or type history for a list of previous commands.","title":"The shell"},{"location":"01.UNIX-Tutorial/intro/#files-and-processes","text":"Everything in UNIX is either a file or a process. A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process identifier). A file is a collection of data. They are created by users using text editors, running compilers etc. Examples of files: a document (report, essay etc.) the text of a program written in some high-level programming language instructions comprehensible directly to the machine and incomprehensible to a casual user, for example, a collection of binary digits (an executable or binary file); a directory, containing information about its contents, which may be a mixture of other directories (subdirectories) and ordinary files.","title":"Files and processes"},{"location":"01.UNIX-Tutorial/intro/#the-directory-structure","text":"All the files are grouped together in the directory structure.

It is probably the most commonly used Linux command. It can be used in a number of different ways. Here are some examples: ls -options arguments ls # List the files in the working directory ls /bin # List the files in the /bin directory (or any other directory you care to specify) ls -l # List the files in the working directory in long format ls -l /etc /bin # List the files in the /bin directory and the /etc directory in long format ls -la .. # List all files (even ones with names beginning with a period character, which are normally hidden) in the parent of the working directory in long format Wild Cards * and ? ls *.doc # List all files ending with '.doc' ls hello* # List all files starting with 'hello' ls ??ll* # List all files with 3,4th chars 'll' cd - Change Directory Change Directory to the path specified, for example cd projects. There are a few really helpful arguments to aid this: cd [DIRECTORY_NAME or PATH] # navigate to DIR or PATH cd ~ # ~ is HOME directory of user also same as cd $HOME cd ../.. # navigate up 2 levels mkdir - Make Directory Make directories with this command mkdir my_folder . Not only can it make the folder specified, but also its parents if they do not exist already using the -p option. The command mkdir [DIRECTORY_NAME] mkdir -p first_folder/next_folder/my_folder # To create multiple new nested folder: # the first, next folder and the next on path There is an option to set the mode, or permissions, via the -m flag, and these can be changed later with the chmod command (see below for more on mode and permissions). touch - Create a File Create an empty file. Touches the file to update the access and or modification date of a file or directory without opening, saving or closing the file. But one of the most common uses is to create an empty file touch my_file. touch [FILENAME] # creates a blank file called 'FILENAME' cat - Display content of a File Concatenate and print files to stdout cat my_file. This command is only for view/ preview. You can pass one or more file names to this command, and even number the lines using the -n to number the lines. Close cousin of this is more , head , tail . Also you can use vi to launch a terminal-based text editor. cat [FILENAME] # to show whole file in stdout (terminal) cat [FILENAME] -n # print line numbers in stdout (terminal) cat [FILENAME_1] [FILENAME_2] [..] mv - move or rename Moves files and folders. The first argument is the file you want to move, and the second is the location to move it to. Use the flags -f to force move them and -i to prompt confirmation before overwriting files. Moving Files and Directories mv [SOURCE_FILE OR DIRECTORY] [DESTINATION_FILE OR DIRECTORY] cp - copy Copies files and folders cp my_file ./projects . The flag -r recursively copies subfolders and files.

Basic Shell Programming. 2.1. Variables. varname=value # defines a variable varname=value command # defines a variable to be in the environment of a particular subprocess echo $varname # checks a variable's value echo $$ # prints process ID of the current shell echo $! # prints process ID of the most recently invoked background job echo $? # displays the exit status of the last command export VARNAME=value # defines an environment variable (will be available in subprocesses) array[0] = val # several ways to define an array array[1] = val array[2] = val array=([2]=val [0]=val [1]=val) array(val val val) ${array[i]} # displays array's value for this index. If no index is supplied, array element 0 is assumed ${#array[i]} # to find out the length of any element in the array ${#array[@]} # to find out how many values there are in the array declare -a # the variables are treaded as arrays declare -f # uses funtion names only declare -F # displays function names without definitions declare -i # the variables are treaded as integers declare -r # makes the variables read-only declare -x # marks the variables for export via the environment ${varname:-word} # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise return word ${varname:=word} # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise set it word and then return its value ${varname:?message} # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise print varname, followed by message and abort the current command or script ${varname:+word} # if varname exists and isn't null, return word; otherwise return null ${varname:offset:length} # performs substring expansion. It returns the substring of $varname starting at offset and up to length characters ${variable#pattern} # if the pattern matches the beginning of the variable's value, delete the shortest part that matches and return the rest ${variable##pattern} # if the pattern matches the beginning of the variable's value, delete the longest part that matches and return the rest ${variable%pattern} # if the pattern matches the end of the variable's value, delete the shortest part that matches and return the rest ${variable%%pattern} # if the pattern matches the end of the variable's value, delete the longest part that matches and return the rest ${variable/pattern/string} # the longest match to pattern in variable is replaced by string. Only the first match is replaced ${variable//pattern/string} # the longest match to pattern in variable is replaced by string. All matches are replaced ${#varname} # returns the length of the value of the variable as a character string *(patternlist) # matches zero or more occurences of the given patterns +(patternlist) # matches one or more occurences of the given patterns ?(patternlist) # matches zero or one occurence of the given patterns @(patternlist) # matches exactly one of the given patterns !(patternlist) # matches anything except one of the given patterns $(UNIX command) # command substitution: runs the command and returns standard output 2.2. Functions. The function refers to passed arguments by position (as if they were positional parameters), that is, $1, $2, and so forth. $@ is equal to \"$1\" \"$2\"... \"$N\" , where N is the number of positional parameters. $# holds the number of positional parameters. functname() { shell commands } unset -f functname # deletes a function definition declare -f # displays all defined functions in your login session 2.3. Flow Control. statement1 && statement2 # and operator statement1 || statement2 # or operator -a # and operator inside a test conditional expression -o # or operator inside a test conditional expression str1=str2 # str1 matches str2 str1!=str2 # str1 does not match str2 str1<str2 # str1 is less than str2 str1>str2 # str1 is greater than str2 -n str1 # str1 is not null (has length greater than 0) -z str1 # str1 is null (has length 0) -a file # file exists -d file # file exists and is a directory -e file # file exists; same -a -f file # file exists and is a regular file (i.e., not a directory or other special type of file) -r file # you have read permission -r file # file exists and is not empty -w file # your have write permission -x file # you have execute permission on file, or directory search permission if it is a directory -N file # file was modified since it was last read -O file # you own file -G file # file's group ID matches yours (or one of yours, if you are in multiple groups) file1 -nt file2 # file1 is newer than file2 file1 -ot file2 # file1 is older than file2 -lt # less than -le # less than or equal -eq # equal -ge # greater than or equal -gt # greater than -ne # not equal if condition then statements [elif condition then statements...] [else statements] fi for x := 1 to 10 do begin statements end for name [in list] do statements that can use $name done for (( initialisation ; ending condition ; update )) do statements... done case expression in pattern1 ) statements ;; pattern2 ) statements ;; ... esac select name [in list] do statements that can use $name done while condition; do statements done until condition; do statements done 3. Command-Line Processing Cycle. The default order for command lookup is functions, followed by built-ins, with scripts and executables last. There are three built-ins that you can use to override this order: command , builtin and enable . command # removes alias and function lookup. Only built-ins and commands found in the search path are executed builtin # looks up only built-in commands, ignoring functions and commands found in PATH enable # enables and disables shell built-ins eval # takes arguments and run them through the command-line processing steps all over again 4. Input/Output Redirectors. cmd1|cmd2 # pipe; takes standard output of cmd1 as standard input to cmd2 > file # directs standard output to file < file # takes standard input from file >> file # directs standard output to file; append to file if it already exists >|file # forces standard output to file even if noclobber is set n>|file # forces output to file from file descriptor n even if noclobber is set <> file # uses file as both standard input and standard output n<>file # uses file as both input and output for file descriptor n <<label # here-document n>file # directs file descriptor n to file n<file # takes file descriptor n from file n>>file # directs file description n to file; append to file if it already exists n>& # duplicates standard output to file descriptor n n<& # duplicates standard input from file descriptor n n>&m # file descriptor n is made to be a copy of the output file descriptor n<&m # file descriptor n is made to be a copy of the input file descriptor &>file # directs standard output and standard error to file <&- # closes the standard input >&- # closes the standard output n>&- # closes the ouput from file descriptor n n<&- # closes the input from file descripor n 5. Process Handling. To suspend a job, type CTRL+Z while it is running. You can also suspend a job with CTRL+Y. This is slightly different from CTRL+Z in that the process is only stopped when it attempts to read input from terminal. Of course, to interupt a job, type CTRL+C. myCommand & # runs job in the background and prompts back the shell jobs # lists all jobs (use with -l to see associated PID) fg # brings a background job into the foreground fg %+ # brings most recently invoked background job fg %- # brings second most recently invoked background job fg %N # brings job number N fg %string # brings job whose command begins with string fg %?string # brings job whose command contains string kill -l # returns a list of all signals on the system, by name and number kill PID # terminates process with specified PID ps # prints a line of information about the current running login shell and any processes running under it ps -a # selects all processes with a tty except session leaders trap cmd sig1 sig2 # executes a command when a signal is received by the script trap \"\" sig1 sig2 # ignores that signals trap - sig1 sig2 # resets the action taken when the signal is received to the default disown <PID|JID> # removes the process from the list of jobs wait # waits until all background jobs have finished 6. Tips and Tricks. ## set an alias cd; nano .bash_profile > alias gentlenode='ssh admin@gentlenode.com -p 3404' # add your alias in .bash_profile ## to quickly go to a specific directory cd; nano .bashrc > shopt -s cdable_vars > export websites=\"/Users/mac/Documents/websites\" source .bashrc cd websites 7.

By operating system, we mean the suite of programs which make the computer work. UNIX is used by the workstations and multi-user servers within the school. On X terminals and the workstations, X Windows provide a graphical interface between the user and UNIX. However, knowledge of UNIX is required for operations which aren't covered by a graphical program, or for when there is no X windows system, for example, in a telnet session. The UNIX operating system The UNIX operating system is made up of three parts; the kernel, the shell and the programs. The kernel The kernel of UNIX is the hub of the operating system: it allocates time and memory to programs and handles the filestore and communications in response to system calls. As an illustration of the way that the shell and the kernel work together, suppose a user types rm myfile (which has the effect of removing the file myfile ). The shell searches the filestore for the file containing the program rm, and then requests the kernel, through system calls, to execute the program rm on myfile. When the process rm myfile has finished running, the shell then returns the UNIX prompt % to the user, indicating that it is waiting for further commands. The shell The shell acts as an interface between the user and the kernel. When a user logs in, the login program checks the username and password, and then starts another program called the shell. The shell is a command line interpreter (CLI). It interprets the commands the user types in and arranges for them to be carried out. The commands are themselves programs: when they terminate, the shell gives the user another prompt (% on our systems). The adept user can customise his/her own shell, and users can use different shells on the same machine. Staff and students in the school have the tcsh shell by default. The tcsh shell has certain features to help the user inputting commands. Filename Completion - By typing part of the name of a command, filename or directory and pressing the [Tab] key, the tcsh shell will complete the rest of the name automatically. If the shell finds more than one name beginning with those letters you have typed, it will beep, prompting you to type a few more letters before pressing the tab key again. History - The shell keeps a list of the commands you have typed in. If you need to repeat a command, use the cursor keys to scroll up and down the list or type history for a list of previous commands. Files and processes Everything in UNIX is either a file or a process. A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process identifier). A file is a collection of data. They are created by users using text editors, running compilers etc. Examples of files: a document (report, essay etc.) the text of a program written in some high-level programming language instructions comprehensible directly to the machine and incomprehensible to a casual user, for example, a collection of binary digits (an executable or binary file); a directory, containing information about its contents, which may be a mixture of other directories (subdirectories) and ordinary files. The Directory Structure All the files are grouped together in the directory structure. The file-system is arranged in a hierarchical structure, like an inverted tree. The top of the hierarchy is traditionally called root . {width=\"397\" height=\"224\"} In the diagram above, we see that the directory ee51ab contains the subdirectory unixstuff and a file proj.txt Starting an Xterminal session To start an Xterm session, click on the Unix Terminal icon on your desktop, or from the drop-down menus An Xterminal window will appear with a Unix prompt, waiting for you to start entering commands. {width=\"479\" height=\"316\"} M.Stonebank@surrey.ac.uk, \u00a9 9th October 2000","title":"Introduction to UNIX"},{"location":"01.UNIX-Tutorial/Unix-Tutorial/introunix/#introduction-to-unix","text":"================= This session concerns UNIX, which is a common operating system.

UNIX Tutorial One ================= 1.1 Listing files and directories ls (list) When you first login, your current working directory is your home directory. Your home directory has the same name as your user-name, for example, ee91ab, and it is where your personal files and subdirectories are saved. To find out what is in your home directory, type ls (short for list) The ls command lists the contents of your current working directory. There may be no files visible in your home directory, in which case, the UNIX prompt will be returned. Alternatively, there may already be some files inserted by the System Administrator when your account was created. ls does not, in fact, cause all the files in your home directory to be listed, but only those ones whose name does not begin with a dot (.) Files beginning with a dot (.) are known as hidden files and usually contain important program configuration information. They are hidden because you should not change them unless you are very familiar with UNIX!!! To list all files in your home directory including those whose names begin with a dot, type ls -a ls is an example of a command which can take options: -a is an example of an option. The options change the behaviour of the command. There are online manual pages that tell you which options a particular command can take, and how each option modifies the behaviour of the command. (See later in this tutorial) 1.2 Making Directories mkdir (make directory) We will now make a subdirectory in your home directory to hold the files you will be creating and using in the course of this tutorial. To make a subdirectory called unixstuff in your current working directory type mkdir unixstuff To see the directory you have just created, type ls 1.3 Changing to a different directory cd (change directory) The command cd directory means change the current working directory to 'directory'. The current working directory may be thought of as the directory you are in, i.e. your current position in the file-system tree. To change to the directory you have just made, type cd unixstuff Type ls to see the contents (which should be empty) Exercise 1a Make another directory inside the unixstuff directory called backups 1.4 The directories . and .. Still in the unixstuff directory, type ls -a As you can see, in the unixstuff directory (and in all other directories), there are two special directories called ( . ) and ( .. ) In UNIX, ( . ) means the current directory, so typing cd . NOTE: there is a space between cd and the dot means stay where you are (the unixstuff directory). This may not seem very useful at first, but using ( . ) as the name of the current directory will save a lot of typing, as we shall see later in the tutorial. ( .. ) means the parent of the current directory, so typing cd .. will take you one directory up the hierarchy (back to your home directory). Try it now. Note: typing cd with no argument always returns you to your home directory. This is very useful if you are lost in the file system. 1.5 Pathnames pwd (print working directory) Pathnames enable you to work out where you are in relation to the whole file-system. For example, to find out the absolute pathname of your home-directory, type cd to get back to your home-directory and then type pwd The full pathname will look something like this - /a/fservb/fservb/fservb22/eebeng99/ee91ab which means that ee91ab (your home directory) is in the directory eebeng99 (the group directory),which is located on the fservb file-server. Note: /a/fservb/fservb/fservb22/eebeng99/ee91ab can be shortened to /user/eebeng99/ee91ab Exercise 1b Use the commands ls, pwd and cd to explore the file system. (Remember, if you get lost, type cd by itself to return to your home-directory) 1.6 More about home directories and pathnames Understanding pathnames First type cd to get back to your home-directory, then type ls unixstuff to list the conents of your unixstuff directory. Now type ls backups You will get a message like this - backups: No such file or directory The reason is, backups is not in your current working directory. To use a command on a file (or directory) not in the current working directory (the directory you are currently in), you must either cd to the correct directory, or specify its full pathname. To list the contents of your backups directory, you must type ls unixstuff/backups ~ (your home directory) Home directories can also be referred to by the tilde ~ character. It can be used to specify paths starting at your home directory. So typing ls ~/unixstuff will list the contents of your unixstuff directory, no matter where you currently are in the file system. What do you think ls ~ would list? What do you think ls ~/.. would list?

UNIX Tutorial Two ================= 2.1 Copying Files cp (copy) cp file1 file2 is the command which makes a copy of file1 in the current working directory and calls it file2 What we are going to do now, is to take a file stored in an open access area of the file system, and use the cp command to copy it to your unixstuff directory. First, cd to your unixstuff directory. cd ~/unixstuff Then at the UNIX prompt, type, cp /vol/examples/tutorial/science.txt . (Note: Don't forget the dot (.) at the end. Remember, in UNIX, the dot means the current directory.) The above command means copy the file science.txt to the current directory, keeping the name the same. (Note: The directory /vol/examples/tutorial/ is an area to which everyone in the department has read and copy access. If you are from outside the University, you can grab a copy of the file here . Use 'File/Save As..' from the menu bar to save it into your unixstuff directory.) Exercise 2a Create a backup of your science.txt file by copying it to a file called science.bak 2.2 Moving files mv (move) mv file1 file2 moves (or renames) file1 to file2 To move a file from one place to another, use the mv command. This has the effect of moving rather than copying the file, so you end up with only one file rather than two. It can also be used to rename a file, by moving the file to the same directory, but giving it a different name. We are now going to move the file science.bak to your backup directory. First, change directories to your unixstuff directory (can you remember how?). Then, inside the unixstuff directory, type mv science.bak backups/. Type ls and ls backups to see if it has worked. 2.3 Removing files and directories rm (remove), rmdir (remove directory) To delete (remove) a file, use the rm command. As an example, we are going to create a copy of the science.txt file then delete it. Inside your unixstuff directory, type cp science.txt tempfile.txt ls (to check if it has created the file) rm tempfile.txt ls (to check if it has deleted the file) You can use the rmdir command to remove a directory (make sure it is empty first). Try to remove the backups directory. You will not be able to since UNIX will not let you remove a non-empty directory. Exercise 2b Create a directory called tempstuff using mkdir , then remove it using the rmdir command. 2.4 Displaying the contents of a file on the screen clear (clear screen) Before you start the next section, you may like to clear the terminal window of the previous commands so the output of the following commands can be clearly understood. At the prompt, type clear This will clear all text and leave you with the prompt at the top of the window. cat (concatenate) The command cat can be used to display the contents of a file on the screen. Type: cat science.txt As you can see, the file is longer than than the size of the window, so it scrolls past making it unreadable. less The command less writes the contents of a file onto the screen a page at a time. Type less science.txt Press the [space-bar] if you want to see another page, type [q] if you want to quit reading. As you can see, less is used in preference to cat for long files. head The head command writes the first ten lines of a file to the screen. First clear the screen then type head science.txt Then type head -5 science.txt What difference did the -5 do to the head command? tail The tail command writes the last ten lines of a file to the screen. Clear the screen and type tail science.txt How can you view the last 15 lines of the file? 2.5 Searching the contents of a file Simple searching using less Using less, you can search though a text file for a keyword (pattern). For example, to search through science.txt for the word 'science', type less science.txt then, still in less (i.e. don't press [q] to quit), type a forward slash [/] followed by the word to search /science As you can see, less finds and highlights the keyword. Type [n] to search for the next occurrence of the word. grep (don't ask why it is called grep) grep is one of many standard UNIX utilities. It searches files for specified words or patterns. First clear the screen, then type grep science science.txt As you can see, grep has printed out each line containg the word science. Or has it???? Try typing grep Science science.txt The grep command is case sensitive; it distinguishes between Science and science. To ignore upper/lower case distinctions, use the -i option, i.e. type grep -i science science.txt To search for a phrase or pattern, you must enclose it in single quotes (the apostrophe symbol). For example to search for spinning top, type grep -i 'spinning top' science.txt Some of the other options of grep are: -v display those lines that do NOT match -n precede each maching line with the line number -c print only the total count of matched lines Try some of them and see the different results. Don't forget, you can use more than one option at a time, for example, the number of lines without the words science or Science is grep -ivc science science.txt wc (word count) A handy little utility is the wc command, short for word count. To do a word count on science.txt , type wc -w science.txt To find out how many lines the file has, type wc -l science.txt Summary command comment cp file1 file2 copy file1 and call it file2 mv file1 file2 move or rename file1 to file2 rm file remove a file rmdir directory remove a directory cat file display a file more file display a file a page at a time head file display the first few lines of a file tail file display the last few lines of a file grep 'keyword' file search a file for keywords wc file count number of lines/words/characters in file M.Stonebank@surrey.ac.uk, \u00a9 9th October 2000","title":"2.

UNIX Tutorial Three =================== 3.1 Redirection Most processes initiated by UNIX commands write to the standard output (that is, they write to the terminal screen), and many take their input from the standard input (that is, they read it from the keyboard). There is also the standard error, where processes write their error messages, by default, to the terminal screen. We have already seen one use of the cat command to write the contents of a file to the screen. Now type cat without specifing a file to read cat Then type a few words on the keyboard and press the [Return] key. Finally hold the [Ctrl] key down and press [d] (written as ^D for short) to end the input. What has happened? If you run the cat command without specifing a file to read, it reads the standard input (the keyboard), and on receiving the'end of file' (^D), copies it to the standard output (the screen). In UNIX, we can redirect both the input and the output of commands. 3.2 Redirecting the Output We use the > symbol to redirect the output of a command. For example, to create a file called list1 containing a list of fruit, type cat > list1 Then type in the names of some fruit. Press [Return] after each one. pear banana apple ^D (Control D to stop) What happens is the cat command reads the standard input (the keyboard) and the > redirects the output, which normally goes to the screen, into a file called list1 To read the contents of the file, type cat list1 Exercise 3a Using the above method, create another file called list2 containing the following fruit: orange, plum, mango, grapefruit.

Also, avoid using spaces within names. The safest way to name a file is to use only alphanumeric characters, that is, letters and numbers, together with _ (underscore) and . (dot). File names conventionally start with a lower-case letter, and may end with a dot followed by a group of letters indicating the contents of the file. For example, all files consisting of C code may be named with the ending .c, for example, prog1.c . Then in order to list all files containing C code in your home directory, you need only type ls *.c in that directory. Beware : some applications give the same name to all the output files they generate. For example, some compilers, unless given the appropriate option, produce compiled files named a.out . Should you forget to use that option, you are advised to rename the compiled file immediately, otherwise the next such file will overwrite it and it will be lost. 4.3 Getting Help On-line Manuals There are on-line manuals which gives information about most commands.

UNIX Tutorial Five ================== 5.1 File system security (access rights) In your unixstuff directory, type ls -l (l for long listing!) You will see that you now get lots of details about the contents of your directory, similar to the example below. Each file (and directory) has associated access rights, which may be found by typing ls -l. Also, ls -lg gives additional information as to which group owns the file (beng95 in the following example): -rwxrw-r-- 1 ee51ab beng95 2450 Sept29 11:52 file1 In the left-hand column is a 10 symbol string consisting of the symbols d, r, w, x, -, and, occasionally, s or S. If d is present, it will be at the left hand end of the string, and indicates a directory: otherwise - will be the starting symbol of the string. The 9 remaining symbols indicate the permissions, or access rights, and are taken as three groups of 3. The left group of 3 gives the file permissions for the user that owns the file (or directory) (ee51ab in the above example); the middle group gives the permissions for the group of people to whom the file (or directory) belongs (eebeng95 in the above example); the rightmost group gives the permissions for all others. The symbols r, w, etc., have slightly different meanings depending on whether they refer to a simple file or to a directory. Access rights on files. r (or -), indicates read permission (or otherwise), that is, the presence or absence of permission to read and copy the file w (or -), indicates write permission (or otherwise), that is, the permission (or otherwise) to change a file x (or -), indicates execution permission (or otherwise), that is, the permission to execute a file, where appropriate Access rights on directories. r allows users to list files in the directory; w means that users may delete files from the directory or move files into it; x means the right to access files in the directory. This implies that you may read files in the directory provided you have read permission on the individual files. So, in order to read a file, you must have execute permission on the directory containing that file, and hence on any directory containing that directory as a subdirectory, and so on, up the tree. Some examples -rwxrwxrwx a file that everyone can read, write and execute (and delete). -rw------- a file that only the owner can read and write - no-one else can read or write and no-one has execution rights (e.g. your mailbox file). 5.2 Changing access rights chmod (changing a file mode) Only the owner of a file can use chmod to change the permissions of a file. The options of chmod are as follows For example, to remove read write and execute permissions on the file biglist for the group and others, type chmod go-rwx biglist This will leave the other permissions unaffected. To give read and write permissions on the file biglist to all, chmod a+rw biglist Exercise 5a Try changing access permissions on the file science.txt and on the directory backups Use ls -l to check that the permissions have changed. 5.3 Processes and Jobs A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process identifier). To see information about your processes, with their associated PID and status, type ps A process may be in the foreground, in the background, or be suspended. In general the shell does not return the UNIX prompt until the current process has finished executing. Some processes take a long time to run and hold up the terminal. Backgrounding a long process has the effect that the UNIX prompt is returned immediately, and other tasks can be carried out while the original process continues executing. Running background processes To background a process, type an & at the end of the command line. For example, the command sleep waits a given number of seconds before continuing. Type sleep 10 This will wait 10 seconds before returning the command prompt %. Until the command prompt is returned, you can do nothing except wait. To run sleep in the background, type sleep 10 & [1] 6259 The & runs the job in the background and returns the prompt straight away, allowing you do run other programs while waiting for that one to finish. The first line in the above example is typed in by the user; the next line, indicating job number and PID, is returned by the machine. The user is be notified of a job number (numbered from 1) enclosed in square brackets, together with a PID and is notified when a background process is finished. Backgrounding is useful for jobs which will take a long time to complete. Backgrounding a current foreground process At the prompt, type sleep 100 You can suspend the process running in the foreground by holding down the [control] key and typing [z] (written as ^Z ) Then to put it in the background, type bg Note: do not background programs that require user interaction e.g. pine 5.4 Listing suspended and background processes When a process is running, backgrounded or suspended, it will be entered onto a list along with a job number. To examine this list, type jobs An example of a job list could be [1] Suspended sleep 100 [2] Running netscape [3] Running nedit To restart (foreground) a suspended processes, type fg %jobnumber For example, to restart sleep 100, type fg %1 Typing fg with no job number foregrounds the last suspended process. 5.5 Killing a process kill (terminate or signal a process) It is sometimes necessary to kill a process (for example, when an executing program is in an infinite loop) To kill a job running in the foreground, type ^C (control c). For example, run sleep 100 ^C To kill a suspended or background process, type kill %jobnumber For example, run sleep 100 & jobs If it is job number 4, type kill %4 To check whether this has worked, examine the job list again to see if the process has been removed. ps (process status) Alternatively, processes can be killed by finding their process numbers (PIDs) and using kill PID_number sleep 100 & ps PID TT S TIME COMMAND 20077 pts/5 S 0:05 sleep 100 21563 pts/5 T 0:00 netscape 21873 pts/5 S 0:25 nedit To kill off the process sleep 100, type kill 20077 and then type ps again to see if it has been removed from the list. If a process refuses to be killed, uses the -9 option, i.e. type kill -9 20077 Note: It is not possible to kill off other users' processes !!!

UNIX Tutorial Seven =================== 7.1 Compiling UNIX software packages We have many public domain and commercial software packages installed on our systems, which are available to all users. However, students are allowed to download and install small software packages in their own home directory, software usually only useful to them personally. There are a number of steps needed to install the software. Locate and download the source code (which is usually compressed) Unpack the source code Compile the code Install the resulting executable Set paths to the installation directory Of the above steps, probably the most difficult is the compilation stage. Compiling Source Code All high-level language code must be converted into a form the computer understands. For example, C language source code is converted into a lower-level language called assembly language. The assembly language code made by the previous stage is then converted into object code which are fragments of code which the computer understands directly. The final stage in compiling a program involves linking the object code to code libraries which contain certain built-in functions. This final stage produces an executable program. To do all these steps by hand is complicated and beyond the capability of the ordinary user. A number of utilities and tools have been developed for programmers and end-users to simplify these steps. make and the Makefile The make command allows programmers to manage large programs or groups of programs. It aids in developing large programs by keeping track of which portions of the entire program have been changed, compiling only those parts of the program which have changed since the last compile. The make program gets its set of compile rules from a text file called Makefile which resides in the same directory as the source files. It contains information on how to compile the software, e.g. the optimisation level, whether to include debugging info in the executable. It also contains information on where to install the finished compiled binaries (executables), manual pages, data files, dependent library files, configuration files, etc. Some packages require you to edit the Makefile by hand to set the final installation directory and any other parameters. However, many packages are now being distributed with the GNU configure utility. configure As the number of UNIX variants increased, it became harder to write programs which could run on all variants. Developers frequently did not have access to every system, and the characteristics of some systems changed from version to version. The GNU configure and build system simplifies the building of programs distributed as source code. All programs are built using a simple, standardised, two step process. The program builder need not install any special tools in order to build the program. The configure shell script attempts to guess correct values for various system-dependent variables used during compilation. It uses those values to create a Makefile in each directory of the package. The simplest way to compile a package is: cd to the directory containing the package's source code. Type ./configure to configure the package for your system. Type make to compile the package. Optionally, type make check to run any self-tests that come with the package. Type make install to install the programs and any data files and documentation. Optionally, type make clean to remove the program binaries and object files from the source code directory The configure utility supports a wide variety of options. You can usually use the --help option to get a list of interesting options for a particular configure script. The only generic options you are likely to use are the --prefix and --exec-prefix options. These options are used to specify the installation directories. The directory named by the --prefix option will hold machine independent files such as documentation, data and configuration files. The directory named by the --exec-prefix option, (which is normally a subdirectory of the --prefix directory), will hold machine dependent files such as executables. 7.2 Downloading source code For this example, we will download a piece of free software that converts between different units of measurements. First create a download directory mkdir download Download the software here and save it to your new download directory. 7.3 Extracting the source code Go into your download directory and list the contents. cd download ls -l As you can see, the filename ends in tar.gz. The tar command turns several files and directories into one single tar file. This is then compressed using the gzip command (to create a tar.gz file). First unzip the file using the gunzip command. This will create a .tar file. gunzip units-1.74.tar.gz Then extract the contents of the tar file. tar -xvf units-1.74.tar Again, list the contents of the download directory, then go to the units-1.74 sub-directory. cd units-1.74 7.4 Configuring and creating the Makefile The first thing to do is carefully read the README and INSTALL text files (use the less command). These contain important information on how to compile and run the software. The units package uses the GNU configure system to compile the source code. We will need to specify the installation directory, since the default will be the main system area which you will not have write permissions for. We need to create an install directory in your home directory. mkdir ~/units174 Then run the configure utility setting the installation path to this. ./configure --prefix=$HOME/units174 NOTE: The $HOME variable is an example of an environment variable. The value of $HOME is the path to your home directory. Just type echo $HOME to show the contents of this variable. We will learn more about environment variables in a later chapter. If configure has run correctly, it will have created a Makefile with all necessary options. You can view the Makefile if you wish (use the less command), but do not edit the contents of this. 7.5 Building the package Now you can go ahead and build the package by running the make command. make After a minute or two (depending on the speed of the computer), the executables will be created. You can check to see everything compiled successfully by typing make check If everything is okay, you can now install the package. make install This will install the files into the ~/units174 directory you created earlier. 7.6 Running the software You are now ready to run the software (assuming everything worked). cd ~/units174 If you list the contents of the units directory, you will see a number of subdirectories. bin The binary executables info GNU info formatted documentation man Man pages share Shared data files To run the program, change to the bin directory and type ./units As an example, convert 6 feet to metres. You have: 6 feet You want: metres 1.8288 If you get the answer 1.8288, congratulations, it worked. To view what units it can convert between, view the data file in the share directory (the list is quite comprehensive). To read the full documentation, change into the info directory and type info --file=units.info 7.7 Stripping unnecessary code When a piece of software is being developed, it is useful for the programmer to include debugging information into the resulting executable. This way, if there are problems encountered when running the executable, the programmer can load the executable into a debugging software package and track down any software bugs. This is useful for the programmer, but unnecessary for the user. We can assume that the package, once finished and available for download has already been tested and debugged. However, when we compiled the software above, debugging information was still compiled into the final executable. Since it is unlikey that we are going to need this debugging information, we can strip it out of the final executable. One of the advantages of this is a much smaller executable, which should run slightly faster. What we are going to do is look at the before and after size of the binary file. First change into the bin directory of the units installation directory. cd ~/units174/bin ls -l As you can see, the file is over 100 kbytes in size. You can get more information on the type of file by using the file command. file units units: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), not stripped To strip all the debug and line numbering information out of the binary file, use the strip command strip units ls -l As you can see, the file is now 36 kbytes - a third of its original size. Two thirds of the binary file was debug code !!! Check the file information again. file units units: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped HINT: You can use the make command to install pre-stripped copies of all the binary files when you install the package. Instead of typing make install, simply type make install-strip M.Stonebank@surrey.ac.uk, \u00a9 October 2001","title":"7.

UNIX Tutorial Eight =================== 8.1 UNIX Variables Variables are a way of passing information from the shell to programs when you run them. Programs look \"in the environment\" for particular variables and if they are found will use the values stored. Some are set by the system, others by you, yet others by the shell, or any program that loads another program. Standard UNIX variables are split into two categories, environment variables and shell variables. In broad terms, shell variables apply only to the current instance of the shell and are used to set short-term working conditions; environment variables have a farther reaching significance, and those set at login are valid for the duration of the session. By convention, environment variables have UPPER CASE and shell variables have lower case names. 8.2 Environment Variables An example of an environment variable is the OSTYPE variable. The value of this is the current operating system you are using. Type echo $OSTYPE More examples of environment variables are USER (your login name) HOME (the path name of your home directory) HOST (the name of the computer you are using) ARCH (the architecture of the computers processor) DISPLAY (the name of the computer screen to display X windows) PRINTER (the default printer to send print jobs) PATH (the directories the shell should search to find a command) Finding out the current values of these variables. ENVIRONMENT variables are set using the setenv command, displayed using the printenv or env commands, and unset using the unsetenv command. To show all values of these variables, type printenv | less 8.3 Shell Variables An example of a shell variable is the history variable. The value of this is how many shell commands to save, allow the user to scroll back through all the commands they have previously entered. Type echo $history More examples of shell variables are cwd (your current working directory) home (the path name of your home directory) path (the directories the shell should search to find a command) prompt (the text string used to prompt for interactive commands shell your login shell) Finding out the current values of these variables. SHELL variables are both set and displayed using the set command. They can be unset by using the unset command. To show all values of these variables, type set | less So what is the difference between PATH and path ? In general, environment and shell variables that have the same name (apart from the case) are distinct and independent, except for possibly having the same initial values. There are, however, exceptions. Each time the shell variables home, user and term are changed, the corresponding environment variables HOME, USER and TERM receive the same values. However, altering the environment variables has no effect on the corresponding shell variables. PATH and path specify directories to search for commands and programs. Both variables always represent the same directory list, and altering either automatically causes the other to be changed. 8.4 Using and setting variables Each time you login to a UNIX host, the system looks in your home directory for initialisation files. Information in these files is used to set up your working environment. The C and TC shells uses two files called .login and .cshrc (note that both file names begin with a dot). (For ubuntu systems commonly the default shell is bash the configuration file in .bashrc ) At login the C shell first reads .cshrc followed by .login .login is to set conditions which will apply to the whole session and to perform actions that are relevant only at login. .cshrc is used to set conditions and perform actions specific to the shell and to each invocation of it. The guidelines are to set ENVIRONMENT variables in the .login file and SHELL variables in the .cshrc file. WARNING: NEVER put commands that run graphical displays (e.g. a web browser) in your .cshrc or .login file. 8.5 Setting shell variables in the .cshrc file For example, to change the number of shell commands saved in the history list, you need to set the shell variable history. It is set to 100 by default, but you can increase this if you wish. set history = 200 Check this has worked by typing echo $history However, this has only set the variable for the lifetime of the current shell. If you open a new xterm window, it will only have the default history value set. To PERMANENTLY set the value of history, you will need to add the set command to the .cshrc file. First open the .cshrc file in a text editor. An easy, user-friendly editor to use is nedit. nedit ~/.cshrc Add the following line AFTER the list of other commands. set history = 200 Save the file and force the shell to reread its .cshrc file buy using the shell source command. source .cshrc Check this has worked by typing echo $history 8.6 Setting the path When you type a command, your path (or PATH) variable defines in which directories the shell will look to find the command you typed. If the system returns a message saying \"command: Command not found\", this indicates that either the command doesn't exist at all on the system or it is simply not in your path. For example, to run units, you either need to directly specify the units path ( ~/units174/bin/units ), or you need to have the directory ~/units174/bin in your path. You can add it to the end of your existing path (the $path represents this) by issuing the command: set path = ($path ~/units174/bin) Test that this worked by trying to run units in any directory other that where units is actually located. cd; units HINT: You can run multiple commands on one line by separating them with a semicolon. To add this path PERMANENTLY, add the following line to your .cshrc AFTER the list of other commands. set path = ($path ~/units174/bin) M.Stonebank@surrey.ac.uk October 2001","title":"8.

There are, however, exceptions. Each time the shell variables home, user and term are changed, the corresponding environment variables HOME, USER and TERM receive the same values. However, altering the environment variables has no effect on the corresponding shell variables. PATH and path specify directories to search for commands and programs. Both variables always represent the same directory list, and altering either automatically causes the other to be changed.","title":"So what is the difference between PATH and path ?"},{"location":"01.UNIX-Tutorial/Unix-Tutorial/unix8/#84-using-and-setting-variables","text":"Each time you login to a UNIX host, the system looks in your home directory for initialisation files. Information in these files is used to set up your working environment. The C and TC shells uses two files called .login and .cshrc (note that both file names begin with a dot). (For ubuntu systems commonly the default shell is bash the configuration file in .bashrc ) At login the C shell first reads .cshrc followed by .login .login is to set conditions which will apply to the whole session and to perform actions that are relevant only at login. .cshrc is used to set conditions and perform actions specific to the shell and to each invocation of it. The guidelines are to set ENVIRONMENT variables in the .login file and SHELL variables in the .cshrc file.

If you open a new xterm window, it will only have the default history value set. To PERMANENTLY set the value of history, you will need to add the set command to the .cshrc file. First open the .cshrc file in a text editor. An easy, user-friendly editor to use is nedit. nedit ~/.cshrc Add the following line AFTER the list of other commands. set history = 200 Save the file and force the shell to reread its .cshrc file buy using the shell source command. source .cshrc Check this has worked by typing echo $history","title":"8.5 Setting shell variables in the .cshrc file"},{"location":"01.UNIX-Tutorial/Unix-Tutorial/unix8/#86-setting-the-path","text":"When you type a command, your path (or PATH) variable defines in which directories the shell will look to find the command you typed. If the system returns a message saying \"command: Command not found\", this indicates that either the command doesn't exist at all on the system or it is simply not in your path. For example, to run units, you either need to directly specify the units path ( ~/units174/bin/units ), or you need to have the directory ~/units174/bin in your path. You can add it to the end of your existing path (the $path represents this) by issuing the command: set path = ($path ~/units174/bin) Test that this worked by trying to run units in any directory other that where units is actually located. cd; units HINT: You can run multiple commands on one line by separating them with a semicolon.

Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source-code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. When developers create something (an app, for example), they make constant changes to the code, releasing new versions up to and after the first official (non-beta) release. Version control systems keep these revisions straight, storing the modifications in a central repository. This allows developers to easily collaborate, as they can download a new version of the software, make changes, and upload the newest revision. Every developer can see these new changes, download them, and contribute. What is GitHub? Github.com is where developers store their projects and network with like minded people. It provides a online platform to sync your code, visually track changes and collaborate with other developers. More information on features provided by github is here Repository A repository (usually abbreviated to \u201crepo\u201d) is a location where all the files for a particular project are stored. Each project has its own repo, and you can access it with a unique URL. Beginners Guide Create a Github account at https://github.com . Remember your usename and password. You will need is everytime you sync your local git repo with github. Git and Github in a nutshell: # Working locally git status # tell whats the current sync status of local repo # Two-step commits git pull # Syncs your local repo git push # Syncs your remote repo # Adding file to stage changes git add [file1] [file2] [--all] # Committing Changes git commit [file1] [file2] [--all] Getting started with a github repo Go to https://github.com and login. Create a new repository (aka repo) with a name for the project. In this example we will use YOUR-REPOSITORY as you repo name. Replace this with you own project name. Now on your local machine, go to the directory under which you want this git project # clone the git repo you created git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git # check local dir ls # you should be able to see repo directory # cd into this git project dir cd [YOUR-REPOSITORY] # create files and folder # finish all your work. # from within the project run git add --all # now commit all the changes git commit --all # you will be asked to write a message with each commit # sync it with remote repository git push origin master For first time push you will be asked for username and password. After you have finished push run the following to remember your credentials for future use. Or else you will be asked to enter password everytime you push this repo. # to remember git crcedentials (user, password) git config credential.helper store # then run git pull git pull First time git usage on a machine can ask you for commit username and email address with instructions of how to set them both. You will need to use the git config --global option to set them both git config --global user.name \"John Doe\" git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com Now check online at https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY to see if the changes you made synced correctly. Next time when when you start working on your project you should always pull before making any local changes. This will sync your local with remote and you will have the latest changes before you start. Following this will allow you to work on multiple machines at the same time. Also multiple users can work on this at the same time. Advanced usage - git branch Git Handbook Github Glossary Some Examples: GitHub and the command line: For developers new to the command line, the GitHub Training team has put together a series of tutorials on Git commands to guide the way. Sometimes, a series of commands can paint a picture of how to use Git: Example: Contribute to an existing repository # download a repository on GitHub.com to our machine git clone https://github.com/me/repo.git # change into the `repo` directory cd repo # create a new branch to store any new changes git branch my-branch # switch to that branch (line of development) git checkout my-branch # make changes, for example, edit `file1.md` and `file2.md` using the text editor # stage the changed files git add file1.md file2.md # take a snapshot of the staging area (anything that's been added) git commit -m \"my snapshot\" # push changes to github git push --set-upstream origin my-branch Example: Start a new repository and publish it to GitHub First, you will need to create a new repository on GitHub.

Create a new repository (aka repo) with a name for the project. In this example we will use project101 as you repo name. Copy the git repo link (HTTPS) from the Download tab.

Create a file helloworld.c #include <stdio.h> int main () { printf(\"Hello World from Unix\\n\"); return 0; } Now compile and run it cc helloworld.c This will generate the compiled binary a.out . Run ls command to check if this file exists. To run the compiled binary ./a.out Hello World from Unix Lets write a helloworld program in python . Create a new file helloworld.py , open it in nano editor and write the following single line of python code. print (\"Hello World from Unix\") There is no compilation step in python since it is an interpreter based language like sh , bash , perl . Whereas C , Java , C# are compiled languages and needs a compiler to convert them into binary. To run this python program we fire the following commands python helloworld.py Hello World from Unix Now that we have this code we want to sync this with github. So we need to go to the projects101/ root directory and then run git add, commit and push. Also we run git congif + pull to save out credentials since this is our first push. git add --all git commit --all # you will be asked for commit message git push # you will be asked for github username and password. git config credential.helper store git pull # run these two so that your credentials are locally saved and git would not ask user/pass next time you push Now navigate to your online repo at https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/project101. You should be able to see the files helloworld.c and hellowold.py . Click on them and browse through the contents. Lets get back to the terminal/ shell that we were using and make changes into these two files. We will create an addme() function in each of the helloworld.c and hellowold.py files. The purpose of this function is to add two integers and then we want to print the sum as output from the code. The new helloworld.c code as follows: #include <stdio.h> int addme (int a, int b) { return (a+b); } int main () { printf(\"Hello World from Unix. I am KrazyCoder.\\n\"); printf(\"I added: 5 + 7 = %d\\n\", addme(5,7)); return 0; } Compile and run the file helloworld.c cc helloworld.c ./a.out Hello World from Unix. I am KrazyCoder. I added: 5 + 7 = 12 Now lets write the same function addme() in python inside helloworld.py as follows def addme (a, b): return (a+b) print (\"Hello World from Unix. I am KrazyCoder\") print (\"I added: 5 + 7 = \", addme(5,7)) Note Python has a simpler syntax; it does not need for ; at line endinngs and variable declaration like int , string , float etc. Also pay attention to the tab/ indentation for functions and loops. There are no curly braces {} in python so the indent defines the content within a function or subroutine. Lets run the python file and you will get the folloeing output. python helloworld.py Hello World from Unix. I am KrazyCoder ('I added: 5 + 7 = ', 12) Now that we have completed making changes to both the files, lets sync these changes to the online github repo. git add --all git commit --all # you will be asked for commit message git push # you will be asked for github username and password. Got to github.com and see the changes in your repo at github.com. Visualize/ track changes on github.com In your github repo page click on \"Commits\" link.

Create a file helloworld.c #include <stdio.h> int main () { printf(\"Hello World from Unix\\n\"); return 0; } Now compile and run it cc helloworld.c This will generate the compiled binary a.out . Run ls command to check if this file exists. To run the compiled binary ./a.out Hello World from Unix Lets write a helloworld program in python . Create a new file helloworld.py , open it in nano editor and write the following single line of python code. print (\"Hello World from Unix\") There is no compilation step in python since it is an interpreter based language like sh , bash , perl . Whereas C , Java , C# are compiled languages and needs a compiler to convert them into binary. To run this python program we fire the following commands python helloworld.py Hello World from Unix Now that we have this code we want to sync this with github. So we need to go to the projects101/ root directory and then run git add, commit and push. Also we run git congif + pull to save out credentials since this is our first push. git add --all git commit --all # you will be asked for commit message git push # you will be asked for github username and password. git config credential.helper store git pull # run these two so that your credentials are locally saved and git would not ask user/pass next time you push Now navigate to your online repo at https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/project101.

Basic components of an HTML file/ source An HTML file consists of tags or elements that define behavior of its components. The basic components are as follows. More reference materials here html tag - this is the top level wrapper that wraps all the elements of the html. head tag - this contains header information of the like like title, styles and scripts as separate tags within this tag as mentioned below in the sub bullets. title tag - Contains text for the title of the page. This will showup as the title of browser styles tag - Conatains the styles ( color, width, formatting etc.) of the elements of this page that are contained in the body of the html script tag - Contains the brain or logic of the operations in this page. For eg. if you have interactive elements like buttons or dropdowns their function/ behavior when a user clicks on them is contained here. body tag - this contains all the text that is visible in the webpage.

The elements are referred to as html tags . Tags are basically containers of text or instructions with a specific purpose defining the behaviour of the element. Some common html elements are: <p> tag - paragraph <h1>, <h2>, <h3> tag - headers of different font size; 1 being largets and then bigger the h-number smaller the font a tag - this is a link tag that often contains a href link. We usually see them as clickable links on a webpage. Usage Syntax: <a href=\"URL\"> DISPLAY-TEXT </a> where URL is the link and DISPLAY-TEXT is what gets displayed on the page which can be clicked. img tag - this tag contains a image that we want to display on our webpage. It contains a src source link to the image file or URL. Usage syntax: <img src=\"http://IMAGE_URL\" ..styles..text...etc... > Note: a tag once opened must be closed to resemble a valid HTML code.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats like pdf , html , doc etc. Markdown is a fast and easy way to take notes, create content for a website, and produce print-ready documents. It was designed for the web, so it should come as no surprise that there are plenty of applications specifically designed for creating website content.

I can even write <b>HTML</b> and it will show up as text. This is great for showing program source code, or HTML or even Markdown. <b>this won't show up as HTML</b> but exactly <i>as you see it in this text file</i>.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats like pdf , html , doc etc. Markdown is a fast and easy way to take notes, create content for a website, and produce print-ready documents. It was designed for the web, so it should come as no surprise that there are plenty of applications specifically designed for creating website content.

We will be using mkdocs to publish reports and data for our future projects. Publishing More info on How Does publishing work? Create a Markdown file using a text editor or a dedicated Markdown application. The file should have an .md or .markdown extension. Open the Markdown file in a Markdown application. Use the Markdown application to convert the Markdown file to an HTML document. View the HTML file in a web browser or use the Markdown application to convert it to another file format, like PDF. There are a number of markdown publishing/ conversion utilities like MKdocs , Jekyll , Hugo , Docusaurus , Read the Docs , Pandoc , Sphynx . For this tutorial we will be using a simple one: MKdocs . MKdocs - A simple documentation engine written in Python. MKdocs Website MKdocs Quick Start Start a new mkdocs project in project root directory To initialise a project with mkdocs, just run the following command from the root directory of your repository: mkdocs new # initialize 'mkdocs.yml' and docs/ in current directory # OR create a mkdocs projects `myproject` with 'mkdocs.yml' and 'docs/' initialized mkdocs new myProject You will see there are two new items created in out project root directory (.) docs/ - a new directory created containing an index.md file in it configuration file: mkdocs.yml Then you just need to edit the mkdocs.yml file to reflect the left menu you wish to offer, with relative paths from the docs/ directory toward the markdown file you want to display. Setup mkdocs configuration Create or modify a configuration file mkdocs.yml in your project root directory. Example configuration: # mkdocs.yml -- MkDocs configuration, all *.md files relative to docs/ site_name: Less-Than-10 Tutorials (<10) theme: name: material #readthedocs # material highlightjs: true # only for readthedocs site_url: https://username.github.io Note we are using the git repo website link as site_url since that is the homepage (entrypoint) for our website. Ready to write markdown documents in docs/ All our markdown files should be contained in this directoy. Best practice is to start any empty folder with a index.md in the docs/. On any web server / service, index is always the entrypoint for any folder or path or url. Then you can add directories or files in any order. Only make sure to add an index.md inside each subdirectory created. Build the mkdocs project We will be using mkdocs for publishing markdown in to web html. mkdocs build [DIRECTORY] # build/ convert .md filed into .html and put in site/ directory. Once you run this command you will see a new directory called site/ which contains the html files generated from the .md documents. Now this folder is ready to be hosted on the web.

I\u2019m just going to rotate through these 5 different genres every day and practice for a few hours. That\u2019ll give me maximum exposure and I\u2019ll be able to rock it out in no time.\" Come Monday, off I went and bought a nice stack of practice books and magazine lessons for the top 20 blues, jazz, and metal songs I liked. Pretty sure I also threw in some 16 minute Pink Floyd solos for good measure... I dragged home the haul\u2014and without even knowing how to fret a basic power chord, I dove into lessons for these wildly differing styles. And, guess what happened... Two months later I had made exactly ZERO progress and was ready to give up the guitar altogether. Whoops. Looking back, I know now what doomed my \"ingenious\" plan to fail: Practicing all these different styles of music at the same time confused my brain and mixed up my muscle memory. All this \"mental context switching\" didn\u2019t help. It just added overhead and made sure I spun my wheels aimlessly. Here's why I'm telling you this: It's easy to make the same mistake when it comes to learning Python. There's no point denying it\u2014modern software development is super complex. And it's getting more complicated by the hour... What looks like a relatively clearly skill set from the outside, turns into a fractal topic as soon as you look closer: Setting up a development environment, grasping the basic syntax of the language, knowing standard data structures and algorithms and when to apply them, understanding Git and source control, TDD and writing automated tests, designing programs for maintainability, ... (Taking a deep breath here.) ... learning how to organize your source code, error handling, what frameworks to use and when, interacting with PostgreSQL and MySQL databases, object-oriented programming, static code analysis, Django, Flask, web applications, APIs, design patterns, linters, code coverage, continuous integration, ... Whoa, buddy. There's simply A TON of stuff you need to pick up\u2014and it get's more difficult if you try to cover it all at the same time. If you find yourself in that situation, my advice would be to keep \"mental context switches\" at a minimum. Don\u2019t repeat my mistake by trying to learn blues, jazz, and metal at the same time. It\u2019s too easy to get frazzled and to lose motivation that way. It can drag your learning progress to a halt. Instead, I found it helps to deliberately limit your choices. Putting some constraints in place will help enhance your creativity and focus: Concentrate on getting good at one programming language (e.g. Python.) Learn how to set up and work with just one database (e.g. PostgreSQL.) Learn how to use one web framework (e.g. Django.) Use one source control tool (e.g. Git.) And so on. Focus on each thing you add to the mix exclusively for some time. Solve problems with the tools and techniques you already know. Let things settle a bit before you start working on a new skill. It's tough, but I know you can see through it and succeed. Good luck, and...

I call these with the same options every time, so I might as well make some aliases. This one will list our disk usage in human-readable units including filesystem type, and print a total at the bottom: alias df=\"df -Tha --total\" We might as well add an alias for our preferred du output as well: alias du=\"du -ach | sort -h\" Let's keep going in the same direction by making our free output more human friendly: alias free=\"free -mht\" We can do a lot with our listing process table. Let's start out by setting a default output: alias ps=\"ps auxf\" How about we make our process table searchable. We can create an alias that searches our process for an argument we'll pass: alias psg=\"ps aux | grep -v grep | grep -i -e VSZ -e\" Now, when we call it with the process name we're looking for as an argument, we'll get a nice, compact output: psg bash USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND 1001 5227 0.0 0.0 26320 3376 pts/0 Ss 16:29 0:00 bash Miscellaneous Aliases One common option to the mkdir command that we use often is the -p flag to make any necessary parent directories. We can make this the default: alias mkdir=\"mkdir -p\" We might want to add a -v flag on top of that so we are told of every directory creation, which can help us recognize quickly if we had a typo which caused an accidental directory branch: alias mkdir=\"mkdir -pv\" When downloading files from the internet with wget, in almost all circumstances, you'll want to pass the -c flag in order to continue the download in case of problems. We can set that with this: alias wget=\"wget -c\" We can search our history easily like with a grep of the history command's output. This is sometimes more useful than using CTRL-R to reverse search because it gives you the command number to do more complex recalls afterwards: alias histg=\"history | grep\" I have a few system tools that I prefer to upgrade from the standard version to more complex tools. These will only work if you've downloaded the required utilities, but they can be very helpful. Keep in mind that these may affect your other aliases. This one replaces the conventional top command with an enhanced version that is much easier on the eyes and can be sorted, searched, and scrolled without complications: alias top=\"htop\" In a similar way, the ncdu command can be downloaded which presents file and directory sizes in an interactive ncurses display that you can browse and use to perform simple file actions: alias du=\"ncdu\" There's an upgraded utility for df as well that's called pydf. It provides colorized output and text-based usage bars. We can default to using this utility if we have it: alias df=\"pydf\" Have you ever needed your public IP address from the command line when you're behind a router using NAT? Something like this could be useful: alias myip=\"curl http://ipecho.net/plain; echo\" For my own purposes, I like to optimize the images I upload for articles to be 690px or less, so I use the ImageMagick package (sudo apt-get install imagemagick if not already available) which contains a command called mogrify that does just this. I have this command in my ~/.bashrc file: alias webify=\"mogrify -resize 690\\> *.png\" This will resize all of the PNG images in the current directory, only if they are wider than 690px.

Command-Line Processing Cycle. The default order for command lookup is functions, followed by built-ins, with scripts and executables last. There are three built-ins that you can use to override this order: command , builtin and enable . command # removes alias and function lookup. Only built-ins and commands found in the search path are executed builtin # looks up only built-in commands, ignoring functions and commands found in PATH enable # enables and disables shell built-ins eval # takes arguments and run them through the command-line processing steps all over again 4. Input/Output Redirectors. cmd1|cmd2 # pipe; takes standard output of cmd1 as standard input to cmd2 > file # directs standard output to file < file # takes standard input from file >> file # directs standard output to file; append to file if it already exists >|file # forces standard output to file even if noclobber is set n>|file # forces output to file from file descriptor n even if noclobber is set <> file # uses file as both standard input and standard output n<>file # uses file as both input and output for file descriptor n <<label # here-document n>file # directs file descriptor n to file n<file # takes file descriptor n from file n>>file # directs file description n to file; append to file if it already exists n>& # duplicates standard output to file descriptor n n<& # duplicates standard input from file descriptor n n>&m # file descriptor n is made to be a copy of the output file descriptor n<&m # file descriptor n is made to be a copy of the input file descriptor &>file # directs standard output and standard error to file <&- # closes the standard input >&- # closes the standard output n>&- # closes the ouput from file descriptor n n<&- # closes the input from file descripor n 5. Process Handling. To suspend a job, type CTRL+Z while it is running. You can also suspend a job with CTRL+Y. This is slightly different from CTRL+Z in that the process is only stopped when it attempts to read input from terminal. Of course, to interupt a job, type CTRL+C. myCommand & # runs job in the background and prompts back the shell jobs # lists all jobs (use with -l to see associated PID) fg # brings a background job into the foreground fg %+ # brings most recently invoked background job fg %- # brings second most recently invoked background job fg %N # brings job number N fg %string # brings job whose command begins with string fg %?string # brings job whose command contains string kill -l # returns a list of all signals on the system, by name and number kill PID # terminates process with specified PID ps # prints a line of information about the current running login shell and any processes running under it ps -a # selects all processes with a tty except session leaders trap cmd sig1 sig2 # executes a command when a signal is received by the script trap \"\" sig1 sig2 # ignores that signals trap - sig1 sig2 # resets the action taken when the signal is received to the default disown <PID|JID> # removes the process from the list of jobs wait # waits until all background jobs have finished 6.

Basic Unix Shell Commands ls The ls command is used to list the contents of a directory. It is probably the most commonly used Linux command. It can be used in a number of different ways. Here are some examples: ls -options arguments ls # List the files in the working directory ls /bin # List the files in the /bin directory (or any other directory you care to specify) ls -l # List the files in the working directory in long format ls -l /etc /bin # List the files in the /bin directory and the /etc directory in long format ls -la .. # List all files (even ones with names beginning with a period character, which are normally hidden) in the parent of the working directory in long format cd Change Directory to the path specified, for example cd projects. There are a few really helpful arguments to aid this: cd [DIRECTORY_NAME] mkdir Make directories with this command mkdir my_folder . Not only can it make the folder specified, but also its parents if they do not exist already using the -p option. The command mkdir [DIRECTORY_NAME] # To create multiple new nested folder: the first, next folder and the next on path mkdir -p first_folder/next_folder/my_folder There is an option to set the mode, or permissions, via the -m flag, and these can be changed later with the chmod command (see below for more on mode and permissions). touch Create an empty file. Touches the file to update the access and or modification date of a file or directory without opening, saving or closing the file. But one of the most common uses is to create an empty file touch my_file. touch [FILENAME] cat Concatenate and print files to stdout cat my_file. This command is only for view/ preview. You can pass one or more file names to this command, and even number the lines using the -n to number the lines. Close cousin of this is more , head , tail . Also you can use vi to launch a terminal-based text editor. cat [FILENAME] # to show whole file in stdout (terminal) cat [FILENAME] -n # to number the lines in stdout (terminal) cat [FILENAME_1] [FILENAME_2] [..] mv Moves files and folders. The first argument is the file you want to move, and the second is the location to move it to. Use the flags -f to force move them and -i to prompt confirmation before overwriting files. cp Copies files and folders cp my_file ./projects . The flag -r recursively copies subfolders and files. rm Removes files and folders rm my_folder. Options below rm [FILENAME or WILDCARDS] # removes all file in the current folder with extension jpg and txt rm *.jpg *.txt # Using -r will again recursively delete subfolders, -f force deletes, and -rf for a recursive force delete. rm -r [DIRECTORY_NAME] # If you want to remove all folders and files in the current directory the command is rm -rf ./* chmod Change mode so you can set permissions for read, write and execute for the user, members of your group and others. This uses binary values as an argument to set these. There are many common chmod permissions, a few key ones are: In general, chmod commands take the form: chmod options permissions file name If no options are specified, chmod modifies the permissions of the file specified by file name to the permissions specified by permissions. permissions defines the permissions for the owner of the file (the \"user\"), members of the group who owns the file (the \"group\"), and anyone else (\"others\"). There are two ways to represent these permissions: with symbols (alphanumeric characters), or with octal numbers (the digits 0 through 7). Let's say you are the owner of a file named myfile, and you want to set its permissions so that: the user can read, write, ande xecute it; members of your group can read ande xecute it; and * others may only read it. This command will do the trick: chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r myfile This example uses symbolic permissions notation. The letters u, g, and o stand for \"user\", \"group\", and \"other\". The equals sign (\"=\") means \"set the permissions exactly like this,\" and the letters \"r\", \"w\", and \"x\" stand for \"read\", \"write\", and \"execute\", respectively. The commas separate the different classes of permissions, and there are no spaces in between them. Here is the equivalent command using octal permissions notation: chmod 754 myfile # this is equivalent to chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r myfile Here the digits 7, 5, and 4 each individually represent the permissions for the user, group, and others, in that order. Each digit is a combination of the numbers 4, 2, 1, and 0: 4 stands for \"read\", 2 stands for \"write\", 1 stands for \"execute\", and 0 stands for \"no permission.\" So 7 is the combination of permissions 4+2+1 (read, write, and execute), 5 is 4+0+1 (read, no write, and execute), and 4 is 4+0+0 (read, no write, and no execute). 777\u200a\u2014\u200aanyone can read, write and execute chmod 777 my_file 755\u200a\u2014\u200afor files that should be readable and executable by others, but only changeable by the issuing user 700\u200a\u2014\u200aonly the user can do anything to the file These are the examples from the symbolic notation section given in octal notation: Symbolic Notation Numeric Notation English ---------- 0000 no permissions -rwx------ 0700 read, write, & execute only for owner -rwxrwx--- 0770 read, write, & execute for owner and group -rwxrwxrwx 0777 read, write, & execute for owner, group and others ---x--x--x 0111 execute --w--w--w- 0222 write --wx-wx-wx 0333 write & execute -r--r--r-- 0444 read -r-xr-xr-x 0555 read & execute -rw-rw-rw- 0666 read & write -rwxr----- 0740 owner can read, write, & execute; group can only read; others have no permissions chmod Examples # Set the permissions of file.htm to \"owner can read and write; group can read only; others can read only\". chmod 644 file.htm # Recursively (-R) Change the permissions of the directory myfiles, and all folders and files it contains, to mode 755: User can read, write, and execute; group members and other users can read and execute, but cannot write. chmod -R 755 myfiles # Change the permissions for the owner of example.jpg so that the owner may read and write the file. Do not change the permissions for the group, or for others. chmod u=rw example.jpg # Set the \"Set-User-ID\" bit of comphope.txt, so that anyone who attempts to access that file does so as if they are the owner of the file. chmod u+s comphope.txt # The opposite of the above command; un-sets the SUID bit. chmod u-s comphope.txt # Set the permissions of file.cgi to \"read, write, and execute by owner\" and \"read and execute by the group and everyone else\". chmod 755 file.cgi # Set the permission of file.txt to \"read and write by everyone.\". chmod 666 file.txt # Accomplishes the same thing as the above command, using symbolic notation. chmod a=rw file.txt man Manuals for a command can be shown with this instruction.

This uses binary values as an argument to set these. There are many common chmod permissions, a few key ones are: In general, chmod commands take the form: chmod options permissions file name If no options are specified, chmod modifies the permissions of the file specified by file name to the permissions specified by permissions. permissions defines the permissions for the owner of the file (the \"user\"), members of the group who owns the file (the \"group\"), and anyone else (\"others\"). There are two ways to represent these permissions: with symbols (alphanumeric characters), or with octal numbers (the digits 0 through 7). Let's say you are the owner of a file named myfile, and you want to set its permissions so that: the user can read, write, ande xecute it; members of your group can read ande xecute it; and * others may only read it. This command will do the trick: chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r myfile This example uses symbolic permissions notation. The letters u, g, and o stand for \"user\", \"group\", and \"other\". The equals sign (\"=\") means \"set the permissions exactly like this,\" and the letters \"r\", \"w\", and \"x\" stand for \"read\", \"write\", and \"execute\", respectively. The commas separate the different classes of permissions, and there are no spaces in between them. Here is the equivalent command using octal permissions notation: chmod 754 myfile # this is equivalent to chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r myfile Here the digits 7, 5, and 4 each individually represent the permissions for the user, group, and others, in that order. Each digit is a combination of the numbers 4, 2, 1, and 0: 4 stands for \"read\", 2 stands for \"write\", 1 stands for \"execute\", and 0 stands for \"no permission.\" So 7 is the combination of permissions 4+2+1 (read, write, and execute), 5 is 4+0+1 (read, no write, and execute), and 4 is 4+0+0 (read, no write, and no execute). 777\u200a\u2014\u200aanyone can read, write and execute chmod 777 my_file 755\u200a\u2014\u200afor files that should be readable and executable by others, but only changeable by the issuing user 700\u200a\u2014\u200aonly the user can do anything to the file These are the examples from the symbolic notation section given in octal notation: Symbolic Notation Numeric Notation English ---------- 0000 no permissions -rwx------ 0700 read, write, & execute only for owner -rwxrwx--- 0770 read, write, & execute for owner and group -rwxrwxrwx 0777 read, write, & execute for owner, group and others ---x--x--x 0111 execute --w--w--w- 0222 write --wx-wx-wx 0333 write & execute -r--r--r-- 0444 read -r-xr-xr-x 0555 read & execute -rw-rw-rw- 0666 read & write -rwxr----- 0740 owner can read, write, & execute; group can only read; others have no permissions chmod Examples # Set the permissions of file.htm to \"owner can read and write; group can read only; others can read only\". chmod 644 file.htm # Recursively (-R) Change the permissions of the directory myfiles, and all folders and files it contains, to mode 755: User can read, write, and execute; group members and other users can read and execute, but cannot write. chmod -R 755 myfiles # Change the permissions for the owner of example.jpg so that the owner may read and write the file.

Putty Fonts, Themes and Appearance: Customizing Putty with powerline Powerline is a really nice looking command prompt and vim status bar. When working on my linux machine, it was very easy to install following the instructions. Trying to get it to work in Windows and PuTTY, however, took a bit of sleuthing. To add onto the complexity, the project has changed, and some of the information that is out there is outdated. So, here is what I did to make it work: Follow the installation instructions for powerline Download and install (double click for install menu) the DejaVu font in Windows. Some of the other fonts in the site worked, and others didn't. PuTTY seems to be picky on what fonts it will use, and the DejaVu font is a nice looking mono-spaced font, so it is a good starting point. (Re)run PuTTY and create a new session with the following settings Window-Appearance-Font = DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline Window-Appearance-Font Quality = ClearType Window-Translation-Character Set = UTF-8 Verify your linux locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8 (mine was out of the box) Verify that your .vimrc has set encoding=utf-8 Verify your term session is capable of 256 colors (TERM=xterm-256color) In addition you can also customize the Colours > ANSI Blue to (RGB) = (108, 108, 187). This will lighten the blue shades of powerline fonts. Useful for Agnoster type arrow themes. And that's it! ssh authentication KEYS Advanced usage with encryption KEYS. To use keys first you need to generate a key pair containing public key [remains in server or the host] ; format .pub (Unix) and .ppk (windows Putty) private key [used by client] Usage Syntax for ssh connection with keys: ssh -i [PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY] [USERNAME]@[IP_ADDRESS] Example: ssh -i /home/towshif/.ssh/AWS-Server2019-Key -p 6789 towshif@server.gentoo.com How To Set Up SSH Keys on Host and Client (Linux) Now lets look at how to setup server and client to use keys. With keys you can also skip password for ssh login. 1. Step One\u2014Create the RSA Key Pair The first step is to create the key pair on the `client` machine (there is a good chance that this will just be your computer): ssh-keygen -t rsa advanced usage: ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/[KEY_FILENAME] -C [USERNAME] Step Two\u2014Store the Keys and Passphrase Once you have entered the Gen Key command, you will get a few more questions: Enter file in which to save the key (/home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa): # You can press enter here, saving the file to the user home (in this case, my example user is called demo). Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Example: The entire key generation process looks like this: ssh-keygen -t rsa Output Generating public/private rsa key pair. Enter file in which to save the key (/home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa): Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Enter same passphrase again: Your identification has been saved in /home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa. Your public key has been saved in /home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. The key fingerprint is: 4a:dd:0a:c6:35:4e:3f:ed:27:38:8c:74:44:4d:93:67 demo@a The key's randomart image is: +--[ RSA 2048]----+ | .oo. | | . o.E | | + . o | | . = = . | | = S = . | | o + = + | | . o + o . | | . o | | | +-----------------+ The public key is now located in /home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. The private key (identification) is now located in /home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa. List the contents of ~/.ssh to view the key files. Public key file: ~/.ssh/[KEY_FILENAME].pub Private key file: ~/.ssh/[KEY_FILENAME] where [KEY_FILENAME] is the filename of the SSH key, which was set when the key was created. Restrict access to the private key so only you (this USER) can access it chmod 400 ~/.ssh/[KEY_FILENAME] Private keys can be used from different clients to connect to the host. Step Three\u2014Copy the Public Key to Host Server that you want to access. Once the key pair is generated, it's time to place the public key on the server that we want to use. You can copy the public key into the new machine's authorized_keys file with the ssh-copy-id command. Make sure to replace the example username and IP address below. ssh-copy-id demo@198.51.100.0 OR copy manually like this or any way you prefer. cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh demo@198.51.100.0 \"mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\" Either one you choose you will see similar output as this The authenticity of host '198.51.100.0 (198.51.100.0)' can't be established.

Make sure you're logged in as the user for whom the key was created. Then, ensure your .ssh directory on the server, and the files it contains, have the correct permissions: chmod 700 ~/.ssh/[KEY_FILENAME].pub # optional if you are only user chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys To Create ssh keys on Windows with putty use this reference: SSH keys on Windows Log In Using Your Private Key You can now SSH or SFTP into your server using your private key. From the command line, you can use: ssh SYSUSER@x.x.x.x If you didn't create your key in the default location, you'll need to specify the location: ssh -i ~/.ssh/custom_key_name SYSUSER@x.x.x.x OR a more verbose syntax # -l [USER] # -i [PATH TO PRIVATE KEY] # -p [PORT] ssh -i /nfs/shared/users/nixcraft/keys/server1/id_rsa -p 4242 -l nixcraft server1.cyberciti.biz Retrieve Your Public Key from Your Private Key The following command will retrieve the public key from a private key: ssh-keygen -y This can be useful, for example, if your server provider generated your SSH key for you and you were only able to download the private key portion of the key pair. Note that you cannot retrieve the private key if you only have the public key. If you're using a Windows SSH client, such as PuTTy, look in the configuration settings to specify the path to your private key. ssh Tips Using ssh config file for easy login : More Info Create a file config in ~/.ssh dir and you can populate it with the host login configurations that are frequently used by that machine. Note : passwords are not allowed to be saven in this file.

Now exit the server ^C and start the server again. You wont see any token generated since a password auth is in place. Now we are ready to deply this as jupyter a service. Setting up notebook server as a service login as user Setup Environment for your service. I use a file for setting all the ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES for this service to use # create env file in /home/fermi/.jupyter/env touch /home/fermi/.jupyter/env Add ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES in to the file as follows. Add venv , CUDA libraries and paths if you have. You can lookup your .bashrc to check if you have custom variables. # file: /home/fermi/.jupyter/env # Note that I am including venv path so that jupyter.service uses this venv binaries.

Since we have provided default access to fermi's home directory and our workspace WorkingDirectory=/home/fermi/users the python venv is enabled by using settings /home/fermi/.jupyter/env you can change the default to jupyter-lab from jupyter-notebook Jupyter Kernels By default ipykernel is installed along with jupyter when we installed the jupyter notebook in previous step. However we also have to provide a kernel for the virtual environment we just created. login as user and list all existing kernels jupyter-kernelspec list Create a custom kernel with python3 from the virtual env with a custom name venvPy3 source ~/venv/bin/activate which python # this should echo > /home/fermi/venv/bin/python python --version # check version just to make sure its the same we installed > Python 3.5.2 # from venv install kernel python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=venvPy3 jupyter-kernelspec list Available kernels: venvpy3 /home/fermi/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/venvpy3 python3 /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/ You should also be able to see native kernels as shown here python3 from native python in /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/ This is happening because of the ipykernel that is installed in the systems python libraries. To install packages with native kernels use --user option. This is however not required for the virtualenv. For our application we would like to disable native kernels and provide user access to only the venv for simplicity. We can add as many kernels as we like in the venv. First check where is ipykernel installed. Login as sudo user pip3 list | grep ipykernel Uninstall ipykernel from system python libs. sudo python3 -m pip uninstall ipykernel Login as jupyter notebook user and activate venv . Now from install ipykernel in venv. # from venv install kernel pip install ipykernel # list existing kernels # install custom venv kernel python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=venvPy3 You can add as many kernel as needed for multiple versions of python from within the venv. All kernels created inside venv are available in the user home at /home/fermi/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/ Start the jupyter service Now we are ready to start the service. Enable and start the daemon # Enable the service sudo systemctl enable jupyter.service Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/jupyter.service to /lib/systemd/system/jupyter.service. # Reload and Restart Service sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl restart jupyter.service # Now check status of the jupyter service daemon sudo service jupyter status output : the daemon is running \u25cf jupyter.service - Jupyter Notebook Server Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/jupyter.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled) Active: active (running) since Sat 2018-11-24 12:09:05 PST; 21s ago Main PID: 8012 (jupyter-noteboo) Tasks: 1 Memory: 40.6M CPU: 824ms CGroup: /system.slice/jupyter.service \u2514\u25008012 /usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/jupyter-notebook --config=/home/fermi/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py login to the jupyter notebook and check Visit the URL, create a new notebook.

Also you should be able to see the 'Python3' venv kernel in the kernel list. To check kernels available run this from commandline jupyter-kernelspec list python3 /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3 To add and rename kernels please refer to jupyter-kernelspec documentation. Check permissions for pip install from jupyter From a new notebook run: ! pip install pandas If you dont get any permission errors during the install you are good to go.
